    <h2><a name="static&#95;workouts"></a>Static workouts</h2><p>Traditional workout plans and training programs are static. They will always present what the author initially intended, and only that. Now if the author is capable he might have created a great workout. But what if an exercise is too hard for you? Or too easy? Or you lack the equipment to do the exercise. Now you're off searching for alternative exercises or for easier or harder variations. And of course, if you don't want to do the same workout the next day you have to go on the hunt again for new inspiration, for new exercises, for the right programming. If you're anything like me you have probably spent hundreds of hours searching for workout plans and training programs.</p><p><label for="mn-static-workouts" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label> <input type="checkbox" id="mn-static-workouts" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="marginnote">   A collection of traditional, handwritten workouts. </span> <img src="/blog/img/static-workouts.png" alt="Image 1" /></p><p>Now, it's probably true that improved programming yields improved results. If you are at the highest level of sports performance then a well educated trainer <i>should</i> probably plan every detail for you. The trainer would adapt a true and tested workout program to fit your levels and your needs. </p><p>But what sorts of results are we looking for? Most of us work out primarily for the health benefits. So we don't want to become a specialist in any discipline and we definitely don't want to do the same exercises over and over. We want to spend less time looking for workouts and more time moving our body.</p><h2><a name="interactive&#95;&&#95;dynamic&#95;workouts"></a>Interactive & Dynamic workouts</h2><p><label for="mn-workout-generators" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label> <input type="checkbox" id="mn-workout-generators" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="marginnote"> Simple workout generators select a preplanned, static workout from a database. Crossfitters use <a href='http://woddrive.com/wods.html'>WOD Generator</a>, where you select the category and a preplanned workout of this category is presented. With thousands of preplanned workouts this yields a good deal of variety. More advanced generators are apps like <a href='http://www.fitstar.com'>FitStar</a> and <a href='http://www.bodbot.com/Workout&#95;Generator.html'>bodbod</a>. These apps take feedback from the user and tries to adapt to create individually suited workouts. Unfortunately, workout generators of this kind typically target the fitness industry and focus on working out, not on movement generally and not on learning new movement skills. </span> An alternative to static workout programs are workout generators; apps or websites that creates workouts for you. The more advanced ones will even adapt to your preferences and your skill level. Workout generators can be dynamic, in that they produce workouts based on ever changing data about the user. But the workouts they produce are often poorly presented and they are rarely interactive.</p><p>So what could a well presented and interactive workout look like? Let's first have a quick look at a more traditional workout. What follows is a gymnastics strength workout of five parts,  designed to increase the strength and conditioning of the whole body. It's a simple workout plan format, with textual exercise names and the number of repetitions and sets. </p><p><img src="/blog/img/old-workout.png" alt="Image 1" /></p><p>This format is nice and compact, but there are some issues<ul><li>You have to know the exercise name. What the hell is a "Shrimp Squat"? You may actually know the exercise, but this name is not familiar to you.</li><li>What if an exercise is too hard to perform? A "Headstand Straight Leg Lift" may be too hard and you would want to exchange it for something similar, but easier.</li><li>What if you don't have the equipment to do the exercise? Maybe you don't own gymnastics rings or don't have access to a pull up bar at the moment.</li><li>Generally, the plan is static; it cannot be changed and it cannot be interacted with.</li></ul><h3><a name="the&#95;redesign"></a>The redesign</h3></p><p><label for="mn-movement-session" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label> <input type="checkbox" id="mn-movement-session" class="margin-toggle"/> <span class="marginnote"> This redesigned workout was created with <a href='http://www.movementsession.com'>Movement Session</a> </span> <img src="/blog/img/new-workout.png" alt="Image 1" /></p><p>With images the plan certainly takes more space, but we have alleviated the problem of having to know an exercise name. Now we learn that a "Shrimp Squat" is single leg squat with one heel pressed to the posterior (time to work on improving my ankle mobility!). An image is less informative than video and a video is less informative than seeing it for yourself. But a good image captures the most important positions of a movement and can convey a lot of information, quickly.</p><p>The new design has buttons for each movement. An 'x' indicates that a movement can be removed. The crossing arrows allows a movement to be replaced by something similar. The '-' and '+' allows replacing the movement with easier or harder variations. The "Headstand Straight Leg Lift" can now perhaps be exchanged with the "Reverse Lying Leg Lift" or the "Headstand".</p><p>This new design presents an easily understandable workout, and a workout that can adapted to fit each users needs. Creating interactive workouts like this will provide more value for a wider range of users. The ability to adjust the workout difficulty allows for far better reuse of the workout.</p><p>And of course, workouts with pictures are much prettier to look at.</p>
